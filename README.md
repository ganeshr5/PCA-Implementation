# PCA-Implementation
Principal Component Analysis

Data set: Digits.mat
This dataset consists of 354 data points (296 for training and 58 for 
testing) each with 64 features in 2 classes (class labels are 8 and 9). The dataset defines two variables, 
one for a training set denoted ‘train’ and one for a test set denoted ‘test’.
The last 65th column corresponds to the label of a class. 

Instructions to run the code:
myPCA(fIlename, num_components) 
where, 
myPCA: Name of the function 
fIlename: ‘Digits.mat’ 
num_components: Number of Principal Components 
Output: Figure of the projected data points is displayed on the screen.
